- 0.2.0-pending:
    - made interfaces for custom NumPyro models more expressive
        - model function may take more than one data argument and produce
            arbitary sample sites
        - preprocess function may return more than one data frame
            which are passed into model (see above)
        - postprocess function now gets a dictionary of sample sites produced by
            model and the original data frame (see above)
        - twinify remains backward-compatible to old models
    - added twinify-tools command as entry point for various utilites
    - added check-model subcommand for twinify-tools to check whether a given
        NumPyro model works with twinify

- 0.1.1: Fix: Constrained dependency versions to address incompatability issues.
