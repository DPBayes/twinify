- 1.0.0-dev:
    - made interfaces for custom NumPyro models more expressive:
        - model function may take more than one data argument and produce
            arbitary sample sites.
        - preprocess function may return more than one data frame or series
            which are passed into model (see above).
        - postprocess function now gets a dictionary of sample sites produced by
            model and the original data frame (see above).
        - instead of a model function, custom models may define a model_factory
            function that is provided arguments from the command line and returns
            a model function.
        - twinify remains backward-compatible to old models.
    - added twinify-tools command as entry point for various utilites.
    - added check-model subcommand for twinify-tools to check whether a given
        NumPyro model works with twinify.
    - twinify main script now stores all arguments received for a run alongside
        the learned model parameters.
    - twinify is now compatible with Python 3.9 but no longer with Python 3.6.
    - twinify now uses cryptographic randomness for DP perturbations.

- 0.1.2: Fix: jaxlib version now constrained for working installation (no
further changes from 0.1.1).
- 0.1.1: Fix: Constrained dependency versions to address incompatability issues.
- 0.1.0: Initial release
